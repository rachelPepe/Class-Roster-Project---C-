# Class-Roster-Project---C++

This is my first C++ project in which I acted as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student file system to a new platform using C++. My goal was to implement a part of the system responsible for reading and manipulating data.

The program maintains a current roster of students within a given course.  The student data includes Student ID, first and last name, email address, age, degree program, and an array of the number of days to complete each course. 

The program reads a list of students and uses function calls to manipulate the data.  While parsing the list of data, the program creates student objects.  The entire list is then stored in an array. 

Functionality is then demonstrated in main() through function calls to create an instance of the Roster class, add each student to classRoster, and print various data to output. I used accessors and getters to print each student's average days in each course and a destructor to release the dynamically allocated memory. 

This project helped me to learn and hone my C++ skills and work through problems as I developed a program.
